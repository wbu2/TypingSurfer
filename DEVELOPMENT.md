## Week 1 (11/14 - 11/19)

I implemented the basic app layout for the game. Additionally, I have drawn the start screen and the game screen. For the game screen I have added the ability to display words in each lane and actively display what the user types. I also implemented the external library ofxCenteredTrueTypeFont.

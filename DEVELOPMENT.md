I was able to create the project using the openframeworks generator.

I implemented the basic enum for game states but was having trouble adding external libraries. Turns out I had to move my project into the openframeworks project folder then add libraries through the generator.

Methods from the ofxCenteredTrueTypeFont library are giving errors. I fixed this by including the main method in this library in my app.h. I drew the start and game screens with ofImage and the font with TrueType font. However, I do not know how to change the font color. Although I have displayed words in each lane and the live word the player is typing, I plan on creating a new UI for displaying what the user types.
